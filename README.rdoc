This is very uncomplete and in early stages. The compiler works by translating YARV bytecode into C code (a Ruby C extension).
Only Ruby 1.9.3-p194 tested! Ruby 1.9.3-p0 does NOT work. Only works on 64-bit OSX with Xcode command line tools installed (in other words, clang must be installed).

== Tests
There are some examples that currently can be compiled in spec/examples.
Run rspec spec/unit/general.rb to run the tests.
